    "generated_sql": "You can support as many customers as you need without paying any extra. Agents are the members of your team that answer and resolve requests from your Customers. In Jira Service Management, you only pay for agents and not the customers who raise requests. For your customers, getting in touch is as easy as responding to the notification they receive in their email inbox. The easiest way for your customer's to request help is by sending an email request to your service project. When emails get sent to your project, they land in your queue as a request. Requests are like emails from your customers asking for help. Like email, you can respond to the reporter and add attachments. Unlike email, you can set all kinds of useful information, such as labels, priority and a status showing where the request is up to. Define and organize incoming requests using request types. Capture and track relevant details upfront by customizing the request types you want to show up on the Help Center. You can also add internal fields to track details that you don't want your customers to see. If customers report a problem that you're tracking in Jira, you can link the requests to the Jira work item to consolidate information and automate progress updates.\n",
